# Spell-Checker-using-Bloom-Filter
Application of Bloom Filter to check spelling of words stored in a file

This is a classic and simple application of a bloom filter. We have a dictionary of 91000
English words (this has been provided to you with the statement), in a text file of size
762KB. We will store these words in a bloom filter of only 91KB (~ one byte per word),
and use it for a spell checker. Our program will read the dictionary from a file called
“dict.txt”; after that, we will ask the user to type in a block of text to spell-check and
indicate the spelling errors.
